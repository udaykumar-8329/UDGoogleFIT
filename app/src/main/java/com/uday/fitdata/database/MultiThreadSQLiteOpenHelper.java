 * MultiThreadSQLiteOpenHelper:<br>
 * enhanced SQLiteOpenHelper for android applications where several threads might access and close the same database<br>
 * <p>
 * With SQLiteOpenHelper, if one thread is closing database, then other threads will crash while accessing a closed database.<br>
 * With MultiThreadSQLiteOpenHelper, a thread does not close the database anymore, but asks for a close with the closeIfNeeded method.
 * It then verifies that each thread asked for closing before really closing the database.
